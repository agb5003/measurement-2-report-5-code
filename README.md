To test the program, download and extract the .zip file. Using a terminal window, execute the file named "main" for linux-amd64 systems, "macos" for macOS systems, or "main.exe" for windows systems. Make sure to use a terminal window, like Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt. Otherwise, the program will quit as soon as the result is shown. On Windows Powershell or command prompt, navigate to the Downloads directory:
```cmd
cd Downloads\measurement-2-report-5-code-main
```
and then run the .exe with
```cmd
.\main.exe
```

On macOS, there is a possibility that the system won't allow executing the "macos" file, because it's downloaded from the internet. To circumvent this, click "show in Finder" or find the file manually in Finder, right click on it, and click open. Afterwards, this executable will be accessible. Now use the terminal to make the program executable and run it:
```zsh
chmod +x macos
./macos
```
